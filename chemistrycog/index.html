        The development of this website came about as a way of broadening
        support for chemistry students while sharing the 18 years of experience
        I have had teaching in a range of secondary schools in England. After
        playing around with Python a few years ago, the opportunity to challenge
        myself to write code to build my own website was an opportunity that
        could not be missed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website structure and layout started with the application of html
        and CSS to give the overall structure and look. Future projects will
        include using Javascript to give more interactivity and functionality
        for users. For those local to Harrogate, I offer tutoring sessions in
        person.

    <h2>About Learning Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="about">
      This section is aimed toward students studying chemistry at GCSE or A
      Level (or, in fact, anyone between the ages of 13-18 studying chemistry!).
      The focus will on content from Edexcel IGCSE Chemistry and AQA A Level
      Chemistry, but can easily be applied to many of the ideas in other
      syllabuses from UK exam boards.

    <h2>About Teaching Chemistry</h2>
    <p>
      This section of the site contains key areas of content where students find
      they become "stuck" or can develop misconceptions and difficulties in
      getting their head around tricky concepts. You will find articles and
      resources developed to support students in picking apart problems and give
      them the tools to tackle them with more confidence.
    </p>

          Success in studying Chemistry can often be down to using bespoke study
          methods to get to grips with often abstract ideas. Of course, before
          you get that far, you need to learn the right vocabulary to apply in
          the first place.
